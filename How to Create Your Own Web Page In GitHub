Hey, fellow coding newbs!
I'm sure you've heard of GitHub, but you may be wondering, 'what is GitHub and what would I use it for?'.
GitHub is a platform that can be used to host your code and to aid with version control.

Steps to creating your very own GitHub page: 
1. Go to: https://github.com/
2. Click "Start a project" to start a new respository. 
3. Name your respository and choose your privacy settings. 
4. Click "Create respository".
5. Now that you've created your repository, you have the option to add files and make the page your own!
6. You can add a "README" to help end users better understand the project you intend to house within your repo.
