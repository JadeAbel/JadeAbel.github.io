<h1>Jade Abel - MIT xPro Fullstack Coding Portfolio</h1>
<h2>Jade Abel</h2>
<p>
  Jade Abel grew up in a small town in rural Pennsylvania. Looking to broaden
  her horizons, she went to college in her nearest 'big' city, Pittsburgh. While
  studying there, she became entranced with her new home. The bustle of a dense
  population center, diverse people, new foods, and the excitement of navigating
  public transit energized her and made her want to immerse herself in the
  goings-on of city life.
</p>
<p>
  But often the pace and noise of the city felt draining and she'd find solace
  in one of the city's many greenspaces. With conservationism and coalition
  building as core values, she began working with local non-profits and
  neighbors to advocate for the city's greenspaces. She lead an effort to
  convert a vacant lot into a neighborhood garden funded by grant dollars.
  Through this work she realized her ability to lead.
</p>
<p>
  Her leadership experience -and enjoyment of it- prompted her to pursue a
  career in project management. In 2018 she received her Certified Associate in
  Project Management from the Project Management Institute. She has worked as a
  Project Manager at PNC for going on three years. She has been promoted twice
  and welcomes the progressive responsbility. Serving in this role at a bank
  pays well, but is not very fulfilling. She'd like to get back to work
  affecting positive change (while making a decent salary in the process). She
  feels that software development is enjoyable and could be a powerful tool for
  making significant impact.
